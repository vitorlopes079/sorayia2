        Advanced Memory and Learning Capabilities
      </h2>
      <p className="main-paragraph">
        At the core of Sorayia.com’s innovation is its approach to memory and
        learning. By employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and digital
        identity technology, avatars are capable of recalling conversation
        histories and remembering fine details, much like a real human would.
        This memory functionality enables avatars to use past interactions to
        enhance future exchanges, creating a more authentic and engaging
        experience for users. Sorayia.com’s 3D avatar creation tools enable
        developers to craft visually intricate, cognitively sophisticated
        characters that continuously evolve—learning from each interaction to
        offer a genuinely immersive experience.
